## 🔍 Summary
Found a bug in [MineFun.io](https://minefun.io) where offensive words could bypass the chat filter using homoglyphs

## 🧠 What Happened
Using [Homoglyph Attack Generator](https://www.irongeek.com/homoglyph-attack-generator.php), I changed the word `idiot` into `idioΤ` (Greek capital tau at the end).

Result: `idioΤ` successfully bypassed the profanity filter and was shown publicly in the in-game chat.
