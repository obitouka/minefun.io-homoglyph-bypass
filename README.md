## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior:
When a user writes a offensive word in [MineFun.io](https://minefun.io) in-game chat, the system blocks it and shows error: `"it's not appropriate for the game."`

## ‚ùå Actual Behavior:
Using [Homoglyph Attack Generator](https://www.irongeek.com/homoglyph-attack-generator.php), I changed the word `idiot` into `idioŒ§`(Unicode U+03A4 at the end) and it bypassed  the profanity filter in the in-game chat and showed it publicly
